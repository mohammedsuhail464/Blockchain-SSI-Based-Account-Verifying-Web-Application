# Overview
The Account-verifying Application is an advanced online tool that streamlines the process of confirming account ownership between two parties, the Sender and the Recipient. It leverages blockchain technology, a secure and transparent digital ledger, to facilitate this process.

An admin can add both the Sender and the Recipient to the system using unique identifiers that protect personal information. The Recipient can then save their unique details on the blockchain using an identity address provided by the admin. These details, along with a unique verifying ID and QR Code, are used for verification purposes.

The Sender can send a verification request to the Recipient using these details. The Recipient checks the Sender’s request and verifies it on the blockchain using their own generated Hash Digital Signature. Once verified, the Sender can check the Recipient’s response on the blockchain, confirming the account ownership.

In summary, the Account-verifying Application is a robust tool that simplifies account ownership verification. It offers a secure, efficient, and user-controlled platform for account verification, ensuring privacy and data control, making it a reliable choice for users.
